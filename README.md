Mullai is a powerful and flexible AI Agent platform built entirely on **.NET**. It provides a robust foundation for creating intelligent, multi-turn conversational AI agents and multi-agent workflows that are equipped with a rich set of **tools, memory, and skills**. Leveraging `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` and `Microsoft.Agents.AI`, Mullai empowers developers to build sophisticated AI assistants with a highly scalable and observable architecture.

## 🚀 Unified Workflow Dashboard (Web UI)

The primary interface for Mullai is now a **modern Web Dashboard** built with Blazor Server. It provides a premium environment for orchestrating multi-agent systems and monitoring complex workflows.

- **Agent Orchestrator**: Build, run, and monitor multi-agent workflows in real-time.
- **Interactive Chat**: Fluid conversations with rich tool-call visualization and streaming.
- **Visual Task Graph**: See the dependency tree of your agents as they collaborate.
- **Observability Hub**: Monitor provider performance, token usage, and execution traces.
- **Centralized Settings**: Effortlessly manage LLM providers and model configurations in one place.

---

## 🏗️ Multi-Agent Workflows

Mullai features a robust **Workflow Engine** designed for complex orchestration beyond simple chat.

- **Dynamic Execution**: Support for Single-Agent and Parallel-Agent execution strategies.
- **Webhook Integration**: Trigger workflows via standard webhooks for seamless automation.
- **Execution History**: Full persistence and auditing of every task run with detailed state snapshots.

---

## 💻 Developer CLI

For terminal-focused development and quick testing, Mullai continues to offer a **Rich Console Application** (powered by Spectre.Console). It provides high-performance interaction, real-time tool-call insights, and a multi-panel layout for deep debugging directly in your shell.

---

## Quick Install (Binary)

### macOS / Linux (Bash)
Run the following in your terminal:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentmatters/mullai-bot/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
Run the following in PowerShell (as Administrator if you want to update System PATH, though User PATH is default):
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentmatters/mullai-bot/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

This will:
1. Detect your Operating System and Architecture.
2. Download the latest `Mullai` binary.
3. Install it to `~/.mullai/bin` (or `$HOME\.mullai\bin` on Windows).
4. Add the installation directory to your `PATH`.

## Key Features

Mullai is designed for resilience, flexibility, and developer-friendliness:

*   **Multi-Agent Workflow Engine**: Define complex collaboration patterns (sequential or parallel) with full execution history, state persistence, and webhook support.
*   **Multi-Provider with Automatic Fallback**: Seamlessly integrates Gemini, Groq, Cerebras, Mistral, OpenRouter, and Ollama. If one provider fails, Mullai automatically fails over to the next available model.
*   **Unified Web Dashboard**: A premium Blazor-based interface for interactive chat, workflow orchestration, and real-time visualization of agent task graphs.
*   **Rich Tool Ecosystem**: Empower agents with a diverse set of capabilities ranging from system automation to document processing.
*   **Observability Built-in**: Full OpenTelemetry integration providing deep insights via distributed traces, structured logs, and performance metrics.
*   **Robust Middleware Pipeline**: Intercept and process messages at any stage with built-in support for tool-calling, PII scrubbing, and safety guardrails.
*   **Persistent Memory & Skills**: Advanced state management with recursive task trees and dynamic, file-based agent skills.

### Core Components Explained:

*   **`Mullai.Abstractions`**: Defines core interfaces and base classes, ensuring a consistent and extensible foundation.
*   **`Mullai.Agents`**: The brain of Mullai, housing the `AgentFactory` and definitions for various AI agent personalities.
*   **`Mullai.Channels.*`**: Projects like `Mullai.Channels.Core`, `Mullai.Channels.Api`, and `Mullai.Channels.Telegram` enable interaction with agents via different communication platforms (e.g., API, Telegram, WebAssembly).
*   **`src/Mullai.CLI`**: Provides a **Rich Console Application** for interactive agent conversations directly in the terminal.
*   **`Mullai.Global.ServiceConfiguration`**: Centralizes application settings, including LLM model priorities and API keys.
*   **`Mullai.Logging`**: Provides mechanisms for comprehensive logging, including LLM request/response details.
*   **`Mullai.Memory` & `Mullai.Skills`**: Manages conversational state, user-specific data, and dynamic, reusable agent capabilities.
*   **`Mullai.Middleware`**: Offers a powerful interception layer for applying cross-cutting concerns like security, data privacy, and function calling.
*   **`Mullai.Providers`**: Integrates with various LLM backends, abstracting away their differences to provide a unified `MullaiChatClient`.
*   **`Mullai.Telemetry`**: Implements shared OpenTelemetry configuration for distributed tracing, metrics, and structured logging across the entire framework.
*   **`Mullai.Tools`**: Contains external capabilities that agents can invoke, allowing them to interact with the operating system, file system, and other services (e.g., weather data).
