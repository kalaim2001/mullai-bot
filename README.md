Mullai is a powerful and flexible AI Agent framework built entirely on **.NET**. It provides a robust foundation for creating intelligent, multi-turn conversational AI agents that are equipped with a rich set of **tools, memory, and skills**. Leveraging `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` and `Microsoft.Agents.AI`, Mullai empowers developers to build sophisticated AI assistants with a highly scalable and observable architecture.

## New: Rich Console Application

Mullai now includes a **rich Console Application** (powered by Spectre.Console) for seamless interaction with your AI agents directly in the terminal. The Console App provides:

- **Interactive Chat**: Engage in conversations with your AI agent in real-time.
- **Tool Call Observability**: Monitor tool calls and their execution status visually.
- **Multi-Panel Layout**: View chat history, current conversation, and status information simultaneously.
- **Streaming Responses**: Experience responses in real-time as they are generated.

---

## Key Features

Mullai is designed for resilience, flexibility, and developer-friendliness:

*   **Multi-Provider with Automatic Fallback**: The `MullaiChatClient` seamlessly integrates multiple Large Language Model (LLM) providers (Gemini, Groq, Cerebras, Mistral, OpenRouter, Ollama, and more). Providers are prioritized, and if one fails, the next in line is automatically tried – ensuring high availability without restarts or downtime.
*   **`models.json` — Centralized Model Catalog**: Manage all LLM provider and model metadata (priority, capabilities, pricing, context window, enabled status) from a single `src/Mullai.Global.ServiceConfiguration/models.json` file. Effortlessly switch providers or models by editing JSON, eliminating the need for code changes.
*   **Extensible Agent Architecture**: Define distinct AI agent personalities and behaviors. Each agent can be customized with specific instructions, toolsets, and conversational styles (e.g., "Assistant", "Joker").
*   **Rich Tool Ecosystem**: Empower your agents to interact with the external world using powerful built-in tools like `WeatherTool`, `CliTool` (for command-line execution), and `FileSystemTool` (for file operations). The framework is designed for easy creation of custom tools.
*   **Robust Middleware Pipeline**: Intercept and process agent interactions at various stages using a flexible middleware pipeline. Implement critical functionalities such as `FunctionCallingMiddleware` (to enable tool use), `PIIMiddleware` (for sensitive data handling), and `GuardrailMiddleware` (to enforce safety and policy compliance).
*   **Memory & Skills Management**: Provide agents with persistent `UserInfoMemory` to retain user context across conversations and dynamic `FileAgentSkillsProvider` to equip them with advanced, context-aware capabilities.
*   **Observability Built-in**: Gain deep insights into your AI agents' operations with full OpenTelemetry integration. This includes distributed traces (parent and per-attempt spans), detailed structured logs for every fallback step, and metrics – all automatically tagged with provider name, model ID, attempt number, and duration.
*   **Versatile Frontend Choices**:
    *   **`Mullai.CLI`**: A fast, interactive **Rich Console Application** with streaming responses, perfect for development and quick testing.
    *   **`src/Mullai.Web.Wasm`**: A modern Blazor WebAssembly web application, offering a rich and responsive user interface for broader deployment.

*   **`Mullai.Tools`**: Contains external capabilities that agents can invoke, allowing them to interact with the operating system, file system, and other services (e.g., weather data).

## Provider Configuration

Mullai separates LLM model configuration from sensitive API keys for enhanced flexibility and security.

### `models.json` — Model Catalog

All model and provider metadata is defined in `src/Mullai.Global.ServiceConfiguration/models.json`. This file acts as your central catalog for available LLMs.

```json
{
  "MullaiProviders": {
    "Providers": [
      {
        "Name": "Gemini",
        "Priority": 1,
        "Enabled": true,
        "Models": [
          {
            "ModelId": "gemini-2.5-flash",
            "ModelName": "Gemini 2.5 Flash",
            "Priority": 1,
            "Enabled": true,
            "Capabilities": ["chat", "vision", "tool_use"],
            "Pricing": { "InputPer1kTokens": 0.00015, "OutputPer1kTokens": 0.0006 },
            "ContextWindow": 1048576
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "Name": "Groq",
        "Priority": 2, // Will be tried if Gemini fails or is disabled
        "Enabled": true,
        "Models": [
          {
            "ModelId": "llama3-8b-8192",
            "ModelName": "Llama 3 8B",
            "Priority": 1,
            "Enabled": true,
            "Capabilities": ["chat"],
            "Pricing": { "InputPer1kTokens": 0.00008, "OutputPer1kTokens": 0.00008 },
            "ContextWindow": 8192
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Common operations (no code changes required):**
| Task | How to achieve |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| Disable a provider | Set `"Enabled": false` on the desired provider object. |
| Disable a specific model | Set `"Enabled": false` on the desired model object. |
| Change LLM fallback order | Adjust the `"Priority"` value (lower numbers are tried first). |
| Add a new model | Add a new model object to the provider's `"Models"` array. |

### `appsettings.json` — API Keys Only

Your sensitive API keys are stored separately in `src/Mullai.Global.ServiceConfiguration/appsettings.json`.
**Important:** Do NOT commit `appsettings.json` with your actual API keys to public repositories. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system in production.

```json
{
  "Gemini":     { "ApiKey": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" },
  "Groq":       { "ApiKey": "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE" },
  "Cerebras":   { "ApiKey": "YOUR_CEREBRAS_API_KEY_HERE" },
  "Mistral":    { "ApiKey": "YOUR_MISTRAL_API_KEY_HERE" },
  "OpenRouter": { "ApiKey": "YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY_HERE" }
  // Ollama typically runs locally and may not require an API key here
}
```
Providers with a missing or empty API key in `appsettings.json` are **silently skipped** at startup and will not crash the application.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Mullai up and running quickly.

### Prerequisites

*   [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
*   **(Optional)** Docker Desktop for running the OpenTelemetry observability stack (Jaeger, Prometheus).
*   An API key for at least one supported LLM provider (e.g., Gemini, Groq, Cerebras, Mistral, OpenRouter) or a local Ollama instance configured to serve an LLM.

### Setup and Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/agentmatters/mullai-bot.git
    cd Mullai
    ```

2.  **Configure API keys:**
    Copy the sample configuration file and populate your API keys.
    ```bash
    cp src/Mullai.Global.ServiceConfiguration/appsettings.sample.json src/Mullai.Global.ServiceConfiguration/appsettings.json
    # Now, open src/Mullai.Global.ServiceConfiguration/appsettings.json and paste your API keys.
    ```

3.  **(Optional) Adjust provider priority:**
    If you wish to change the order in which LLM providers are tried, or enable/disable specific models, edit `src/Mullai.Global.ServiceConfiguration/models.json`.

4.  **Run the Console App (for a quick interactive experience):**
    ```bash
    cd src/Mullai.CLI
    dotnet run
    ```

5.  **Run the Blazor Web App (for a rich UI experience):**
    ```bash
    cd src/Mullai.Web.Wasm/Mullai.Web.Wasm
    dotnet run
    ```

## Observability

Mullai provides deep observability out-of-the-box, essential for understanding and debugging complex AI agent behaviors. The `docker/observability` folder contains a `docker-compose.yml` to spin up a local OpenTelemetry stack (Jaeger for tracing, Prometheus for metrics).

`MullaiChatClient` automatically emits:

*   **Distributed Traces**: Each agent request generates a parent span, and every LLM provider attempt gets a child span. These spans are richly tagged with `mullai.provider`, `mullai.model`, `mullai.attempt`, `mullai.duration_ms`, and `mullai.success`, allowing you to trace the exact path of a request and identify bottlenecks.
*   **Structured Logs**: Detailed logs are emitted at various levels (`Information` for startup and successful attempts, `Warning` for fallback scenarios, `Error` when all providers fail), providing granular insight into the agent's decision-making process.
*   **Metrics**: Essential performance metrics are automatically collected, giving you a quantitative view of your agents' health and performance.
